nomifactory.quest.normal.db.0.title=Charging Quartz
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.0.desc=The main purpose for this device is to turn §6Certus Quartz§r into §6Charged Certus Quartz Crystals§r.%n%nThis device can be powered with RF via energy conduits or use AE energy from a network via ME conduits or cables.%n%nIt accepts power from two sides. Which two sides? It's pretty easy to guess.%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%nOk, ok. It's the top and bottom.%n%n

# db 1 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1.title=Crystal Growth Chamber
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1.desc=The §3Crystal Growth Chamber§r allows you to perform §bApplied Energistics§r's world crafting recipes inside of a machine. Hooray, you never have to drop more things in water again!%n%nIt is used for growing §6Crystal Seeds§r into §6Pure Crystals§r, and also for creating §6Fluix Crystals§r.%n%nJEI doesn't show the Chamber's recipes directly, so we'll explain it here:%n%nSeeds are made by pulverizing any of the three crystal types and mixing the dust with sand. A seed grows into the corresponding Pure Crystal, which is substitutable for the original crystal in most recipes. Using Pure Crystals lets you effectively double your material efficiency, which is nice. And no, you can't grind down Pure Crystals to further multiply your resources. Sorry.%n%nFluix Crystals you've already had to make in a pool of water by now, and it's the same ingredients here: insert one each of a §6Redstone§r, §6Charged Certus Quartz Crystal§r, and a §6Nether Quartz§r to produce two Fluix Crystals.

# db 2 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.2.title=Canning Machine and Assorted Stuff
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.2.desc=Note: this quest accepts both LV and MV Canning Machines.%n%n§aLV Batteries§r were very simple to make, but more effective forms of power storage will be more complex to build, so we'll need to lay the groundwork now.%n%nPut your §3Centrifuge§r to work for the §6Antimony§r you'll need, which comes in tiny piles from processing §6Tetrahedrite Ore§r and §6Stibnite Ore§r.%n%n

# db 3 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.3.title=§2Genesis
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.3.desc=Welcome to §5Nomifactory§r §2GTCEu Edition§r!%n%nThis pack is intended to be played in a §bLost Cities / Overworld dimension§r.%n%nIf you're playing with friends, don't forget to invite them to the §equestbook party§r.%n%n§rIf you wish to build your base in a skyblock world, place the §6Void World Cake§r down on the ground, and eat a slice to be sent to the void. Please note that you'll still need to return to the Lost Cities / Overworld dimension to mine, but you can freely build in complete safety in the §eVoid World§r.%n%nFeatures new to §2CEu§r and quests with new content will be highlighted in §2dark green (colour 2)§r.

# db 4 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.4.title=Iron Supply
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.4.desc=§c§rOres in §5Nomifactory§r exist in large clusters, or '§eveins§r'. These veins are scattered around the world, and are relatively common. §2The upgraded HV Electric Prospector's Scanner you were given will tell you the types of ores you can find within a 7x7 chunk area!%n§r%nWhile the Scanner requires energy to work, you are unlikely to deplete its battery. That said, the quest book will later guide you towards making §2an HV Battery§r to charge §aHV tools §rin your inventory.%n%nIn order to proceed, you'll need to locate a source of §6Iron§r. You have a few options. §6Magnetite§r veins are higher up and contain large amounts of iron, as well as some §6Vanadium§r and §6Gold§r. Another good source of iron is §6Limonite§r veins, which contain several types of iron. Finally, §6Pyrite§r can be found paired with §6Copper§r in several types of veins.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§r is obtained simply by §esmelting Iron a second time§r. It has more durability than Iron, so it is better for making tools, but §cdo not convert your entire Iron supply over to Wrought Iron§r. The two materials are not interchangeable and you'll need Iron or Wrought Iron as demanded by various recipes.

# db 5 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.5.title=Mining Hammers
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.5.desc=§aMining Hammers§r offer a relatively cheap way to mine out areas much faster. They clear a 3x3 of blocks (unless you're crouching) and mine quickly.%n%n§2GTCEu now has Mining Hammers natively! You can craft them with any GT tool material. §r%n%nYour free 4 Diamond Mining Hammers should last you a while, and you can always fix them using an anvil and some diamonds.

# db 6 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.6.title=§2More Materials
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.6.desc=Before you continue, you'll need access to some more materials. %n%n§6Redstone§r: Found only deep in the world, in massive veins paired with §6Cinnabar§r and §6Ruby§r.%n%n§6Copper§r: Two primary sources. §6Tetrahedrite§r veins are higher up, while §6Chalcopyrite§r veins are lower, paired with some small amounts of §6Iron§r. You'll also find §6Malachite§r inside of Iron veins, this is another type of copper ore.%n%n§6Tin§r: Found essentially at ground level. §6Cassiterite§r is another type of tin ore, and they're always found together. If you cannot find a vein of tin, there are small amounts of tin inside veins of §6Aluminium§r and §6Rock Salt§r, which might be enough to hold you over until you find a proper tin vein.%n%n§6Coal§r: Found in relatively shallow depths. §6Lignite Coal§r is §2removed.%n%n§6Gold§r: Found inside of §6Magnetite§r veins, close to the surface.

# db 7 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.7.title=§2Cables
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.7.desc=The most basic cables, such as these §6Red Alloy Cables§r, can be wrapped in their §6Rubber§r insulation by hand.%n%nMore advanced types of cables will require an §3Assembling Machine§r and liquid §9Rubber§r, but you can do it the simple way for now.%n%n§2CEu has GT6-style pipes and cables on by default. §rYou will need to use §aWire Cutters§r to connect each side of a cable to machines or other cables. Placing it against the machine or cable automatically connects it as well. The same behaviour follows for GT pipes, whose tool is the §aWrench§r.%nThis can save you from energy or fluids going the wrong way. But if you don't like this, disable the config option for "GT6 style pipes and cables" in the GregTech config file.%n%n§2GT cables now support RF conversion natively! §rYou can plug an §dRF§r machine into an §dEU§r cable directly and it will convert the energy. You cannot, however, plug an §dRF§r power souce directly into an §dEU§r cable.

# db 8 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.8.title=The Third Tier Three Circuits
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.8.desc=With three §6Microcircuits§r and some standard components, you can upgrade to the penultimate Tier Three circuit: a §6Microprocessor§r.

# db 9 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.9.title=§2Ore Doubling?
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.9.desc=In most expert packs, you want to try to process as little ore as possible before you get access to ore doubling. It's a habit most of us pick up.%n%n§eYou shouldn't feel any pressure to do that in Nomifactory, though§r. Ore veins are massive, and mining is extremely fast with §aMining Hammers§r. What's more, even once you get access to §3Macerators§r, they initially process ore slowly and require power to operate.%n%nObvious exceptions would be rare materials or anything you buy with §dNomicoins §rbecause you can't find it. Those are worth doubling, if possible.%n%nBut at least for now, you shouldn't feel any guilt about smelting the more common ores without doubling them! §eOre doubling can be safely ignored until you have the §2Steam Grinder§r§e, or Medium Voltage machines or even later.§r

# db 10 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.10.title=§2Tier Two Micro Miner
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.10.desc=The Second Micro Miner! §2You'll need that Phosphorous in the LV Field Generators.§r%n%nThis uses an §bExtended Crafting§r table so it's not possible to automate the Miner itself with §bApplied Energistics 2§r just yet (this requires more advanced technology not easy to access until the Tier Four Micro Miner). You can make it semi-automatically by prestocking the components you need, and filling up the Extended Crafting Table with §bJEI§r!%n%nThis Micro Miner can get you:§6%n* Bauxite Ore%n§2* Pyrochlore Ore§6%n* Copper Ore%n§2* Sphalerite Ore§r%n§6* Cassiterite Ore%n* Scheelite Ore%n* Tungstate Ore%n* Radium Salt§r%n%nAs well as the §6Stellar Creation Data§r, which will be useful much, much later.%n%n§2A new mission is available in CEu. This mission costs HV Electric Pumps and Cryotheum Dust. This nets you Solidified Neon, Xenon and Krypton, although it is better to get those from distilling Liquid Nether and Ender Air, as of the useful byproducts you get, and the tiny amount of each element you get in this mission.

# db 11 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.11.title=§2Electronics Subcomponents
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.11.desc=A "§esubstrate§r" is the "board" part of a circuit board... the backing that the circuit components and wires are laid into. A good substrate needs to not conduct electricity, for obvious reasons. §6Wood§r coated in §6Sticky Resin§r is a primitive but effective material to use as your first substrate.%n%n§2CEu circuit progression means you also have to put wires on your substrates for them to be usable. In this case, use some Fine Copper Wires.§r%n%nYou'll also need to make §6Vacuum Tubes§r, as well as some primitive §6Resistors§r. §6Paper§r will work as a material for these, for now.%n%nMake sure to code these recipes into a §3Crafting Station§r... you'll be making a LOT of these things.

# db 12 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.12.title=Some Starter Tools
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.12.desc=One of the eccentricities of the pack you'll need to get used to is the way the tools are displayed. Most tools can be made out of nearly any metal, and §bJEI§r will display a huge number of options... every combination of every tool with every material. However, the pattern to make the tool is always identical, so §ejust arrange the plates and ingots in the same manner as the examples, ignoring whatever material it says§r. Rods where rods go, plates where plates, etc. The only restriction is that tools §emust be made from all of the same material§r... you cannot mix and match different metals in a single item.%n%nRecipes will default to showing a §6Iron tool §rof the appropriate type if a tool is required, but the correct type of tool made out of any metal will work. Just ignore the tool's material in the recipes: it can be whatever you'd like.%n%nFor now, make a §aHammer§r (not a §aMining Hammer§r, mind you... six ingots, not plates). Hammers can be used to turn §etwo ingots into one plate§r. §6Plates§r can make a §aFile§r, Files can make §6Rods§r, etc. Use JEI to work your way down the list of tools.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§r is probably your best bet for a tool material right now, but better materials will become available as you progress. This quest accepts any tool material.

# db 13 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.13.title=Batch Crafting In Style
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.13.desc=If you try to craft each item only when you need it, you'll go insane. It is far more effective to §ebatch-craft§r frequently used items so you don't have to do it as often. It is very satisfying to get all the ingredients together then craft §ea stack of items§r all at once.%n%n§3Crafting Stations§r are an indispensable tool for batch-crafting. They can save recipes for all the steps in production chains for things like tools, circuits, machine casings, and more. You will want to §emake several of them§r§r for the convenience they offer.%n%nEach Crafting Station comes with some inventory space for general items, as well as a dedicated row specifically for holding §bGregTech§r tools. In addition, Crafting Stations can §einteract with adjacent inventories§r, so you can keep common materials in a container between them. This includes access points to large virtual inventories, like a §aDrawer Controller§r§r, which you will be able to make later.%n%nTo use the Crafting Station, you must either manually set up a recipe in the pattern area, or click-in a table recipe from §bJEI§r. Place the ingredients inside the Crafting Station or an adjacent container, then you can click the resulting item to craft it. Once an item is crafted, the recipe will appear on the top-right in the history pane. As usual, Shift-clicking the output item will craft up to a stack of it.%n%nEach Crafting Station will remember §eup to the last nine recipes§r you made in them, which can be recalled by clicking the item in the top-right recipe history pane. Old recipes will be cycled out, so if you want to ensure a recipe doesn't ever get replaced by a different one, §eShift-click the recipe in the history pane to lock it§r.%n%nThe available ingredients from neighboring inventories are visible through the §eStorage§r tab on the Crafting Station, and you can also place items into this tab to send them to available neighboring inventories.

# db 14 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.14.title=Furnace v2.0
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.14.desc=§3Iron Furnaces§r can smelt an item in §a150 ticks§r, which is somewhat faster than a vanilla §6Furnace§r, which takes §a200 ticks§r. The fuel efficiency remains the same for all furnaces.

# db 15 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.15.title=Furnace v3.0
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.15.desc=§3Copper Furnaces§r are another step up in speed, taking §a100 ticks§r to smelt an item.

# db 16 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.16.title=Furnace v4.0
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.16.desc=§3Silver Furnaces§r are another step up in speed, taking a mere §a60 ticks§r to smelt an item.

# db 17 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.17.title=Furnace v5.0
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.17.desc=§3Gold Furnaces§r are yet another step up in speed, taking only §a40 ticks§r to smelt an item.

# db 18 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.18.title=Furnace v7.0
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.18.desc=While §3Obsidian Furnaces§r are the same speed as §3Diamond Furnaces§r, they have twice the throughput since they can §esmelt two items at once§r.%n%nYou may find that Diamond Furnaces suit your needs better than Obsidian, but they'll both be crafting ingredients in various machines soon enough, so crafting one is not a waste, even if you don't use it.

# db 19 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.19.title=LV Alloy Smelter
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.19.desc=Alloy Smelters are used to create alloys by melting and reforming items together.%n%nNow you won't need to grind up metals into dusts and mix them for alloy dusts! Plus, many of the more complex alloys you couldn't make that way are now possible.

# db 20 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.20.title=Furnace v6.0
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.20.desc=§3Diamond Furnaces§r are the fastest available, taking only §a25 ticks§r to smelt an item.

# db 21 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.21.title=§2Steel
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.21.desc=You already have §6Steel§r, but it can be made much faster in the §3Alloy Smelter§r, at the cost of EU.%n%nYou might want to save your §6Coal Dust§r for circuits and use §6Charcoal Dust§r instead. Later, you can also process either of these dusts, §6Coal Coke Dust§r, §2or Diamond Dust§r into §6Carbon Dust§r, which can be used for Steel and other useful things.

# db 22 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.22.title=§2Pyrolyse Oven
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.22.desc=The main function of this oven is to increase the fuel values of your wood and coal while also recovering some of the various potentially useful waste products.%n%nTurning §6Coal§r into §6Coal Coke§r will not only make it more useful as fuel, but will also produce §9Phenol§r, which you'll need for circuits.%n%nThe Pyrolyse Oven is also the source of several other fluids that can be distilled for useful ingredients.%n%nRemember that Hatches and Buses can be replaced by Hatches and Buses of any tier, although the Input Bus must be at least LV, as there are 2 inputs, and that you can  §6sneak-right click§r the controller to enable the in-world preview.%n%n§2As stated in the tooltip, higher tier coils will make this faster.%n

# db 23 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.23.title=Obsidian
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.23.desc=You'll need §6Obsidian§r to make §6Dark Steel§r. Most of the tools you can make cannot mine Obsidian, but you do have a few potential options for ones that will work. The options you're most likely to have access to at this point are:%n%n1) A §aDiamond Pickaxe§r or §aDiamond Mining Hammer§r.%n%n2) A §aPlatinum Mining Hammer§r (not pickaxe though).%n%nLater. you can use a §3Rock Breaker§r at voltage §aHV§r or higher to make §6Obsidian§r without spending §6Lava§r!

# db 24 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.24.title=Steam Dynamo
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.24.desc=Your first major crafting project!%n%nThe §6Steam Dynamo§r will be your source of §dpower§r for the early game. It requires §9Water§r and burnable fuel like §6Coal§r or §6Sugar Cane§r to produce power.%n%nYou'll need a small bit of §6Silver§r for this dynamo. If you haven't found a §6Galena vein§r yet (which is where Silver is), then consider "buying" some §6Silver Ore§r using §dNomicoins§r. You won't need a ton of silver and lead just yet, so it won't bankrupt you.%n%nKeep in mind that §eDynamos only output power when burning through fuel, and only the block attached directly to the coil will get provided with power§r.

# db 25 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.25.title=Cake Based Dimensional Transit
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.25.desc=This quest is repeatable once per hour and gives you a free cake to the Void World or Overworld. You can also refill your cakes with the items indicated in their tooltips.

# db 26 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.26.title=Dark Steel
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.26.desc=§6Steel§r alloyed with §6Obsidian§r makes §6Dark Steel§r, which is needed for many of the machines in §bEnderIO§r and §bApplied Energistics§r.%n%nLater, you can use §6Void Crystal§r instead of Obsidian.

# db 27 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.27.title=LV Chemical Reactor
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.27.desc=The place for your very first chemical reactions, namely making some improved substrates.

# db 28 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.28.title=Pulsating Dust
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.28.desc=§6Pulsating Dust§r is a mysterious magical material that taps into the power of Ender. It has all sorts of strange and potentially dangerous applications, including the ability to make §6Pulsating Ingots§r and §6Ender Pearls§r.%n%nYour first source of Pulsating Dust is §6Uraninite§r, which you can get from §6Uraninite Ore§r. Later on, you'll be able to produce Pulsating Dust by smelting §6Resonant Clathrates§r.%n%n§cPlease note that the Enderpearl Dust electrolysis recipe requires an EV Electrolyzer, and is most likely not worth it.§r

# db 29 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.29.title=Pulsating Iron and Ender Pearls
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.29.desc=A mysterious alloy, made from §6Pulsating Dust§r and §6Iron§r.%n%nIf you can't find one otherwise, §6Ender Pearls§r can be crafted using Pulsating Dust and a §6Diamond§r in an §3Alloy Smelter§r.

# db 30 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.30.title=Electrical Steel
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.30.desc=A refined type of steel, made from §6Silicon Dust§r and §6Steel§r.%n%nThis material is frequently used in electronics and digital equipment.

# db 31 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.31.title=Vibrant Capacitor Bank
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.31.desc=Two §aAdvanced Capacitor Banks§r can be grafted together with a §6Vibrant Crystal§r and §6Vibrant Alloy Plates§r to create a §aVibrant Capacitor Bank§r, which stores five times as much RF as the advanced bank, for a total of twenty-five times as much as the basic bank.

# db 32 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.32.title=Advanced Capacitor Bank
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.32.desc=Two §aCapacitor Banks§r can be grafted together with a §6Double-Layer Capacitor§r and §6Electrical Steel§r to create an §aAdvanced Capacitor Bank§r, which stores five times as much RF as the basic bank.

# db 33 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.33.title=Basic Capacitor Bank
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.33.desc=Expandable multi-block storage for RF power.%n%nThis first tier isn't much, but you can upgrade them over time to hold substantial amounts of power.

# db 34 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.34.title=§2Energetic Alloy
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.34.desc=This alloy is made from §2mixing 2 Gold Dust, 1 Redstone, and 1 Glowstone Dust in a Mixer, creating Energetic Alloy Dust,§r and putting it in your new §3Electric Blast Furnace§r.%n%nThrow §2the prepared dust into the input bus§r and in twenty seconds your §6Energetic Alloy Ingot§r will be in the output bus.%n%n§2In EV Age, you can build an Alloy Blast Smelter which doubles the yield.

# db 35 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.35.title=§2Vibrant Alloy
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.35.desc=Another alloy.%n%n§2In EV Age, you can build an Alloy Blast Smelter which doubles the yield.

# db 37 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.37.title=Rubber Sheets
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.37.desc=Going out in search of a §6Rubber Tree§r is a viable option for sure. However, if this isn't appealing, you can also §eshear leaves§r and make §6Plantballs§r out of them. Plantballs smelt into §6Slime§r, and Slime smelts into §6Rubber§r.%n%nYou'll want to transition to Rubber Trees at some point, though, since the §eratio of leaves to rubber is quite poor§r.%n%nRubber can be hammered into sheets just like metals can be turned to plates. It's quite inefficient to do it this way, but such is the life of early game §bGregTech§r. At least rubber isn't particularly hard to come by.

# db 38 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.38.title=§2LV Power
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.38.desc=§oNote: this quest accepts any §2§oLV Energy Converter§r§o.%n%n§rThe §3Steam Dynamos§r§r§r you have made are generating §aRF power§r, but §bGregTech§r machines require §aEU power§r. With your first §6circuit§r in hand, you are ready to build a §eLow Voltage (LV) §3§2Energy Converter§r.%n%nThe §2Energy Converter§r is a special device that §econverts §2between §aRF power§r and §aEU power§r. They come in §2four sizes: 1A, 4A, 8A, and 16A.%n%n§aRF§r converts into §aEU§r at a §e4 to 1 ratio§r. §a100 RF§r becomes §a25 EU§r, and vice-versa. §2Use a Soft Hammer to change the conversion direction.

nomifactory.quest.normal.db.154.desc=With tier three circuits in hand, it's time to make a §3Distillation Tower§r, which is the gatekeeper for more advanced plastics like §6Epoxy§r and doing petrochemistry.%n%nThe Distillation Tower is a highly flexible multiblock structure, able to be anywhere from §62 blocks high to up to 13 high§r (12 fluid outputs). The way that it works is that each level of the tower after the first will output an additional fluid from the recipe. §cAny output fluids in excess of available buses are voided§r. %n%nWhat you need the Distillation Tower for initially is to break down §9Oil§r and §9Fermented Biomass§r into useful resources.§9 Oil§r distillation, with its four outputs, will require a §efive-block-high Distillation Tower§r (the quest materials are for such a tower; if you want to build it bigger, you will need §ean additional 7 casings and 1 fluid output per floor§r).%n%nAny recipe with more than four output fluids (like §9Fermented Biomass§r) will need a larger tower. Make sure to increase the height of your tower to accommodate all of the outputs you want to keep. Also check the voltage requirements of the recipes, as many Distillation Tower recipes need higher voltages than MV. §eYou can swap out your Energy Input for a higher tier one when that time comes§r. Also, any recipe that has an item output will need an §6Output Bus§r, anywhere on the bottom layer.%n%nThe tower we'll be building at first is 3x3x5 (LxWxH), with a hollow center. The §6Fluid Input Hatch§r §2can go anywhere on the bottom layer.§r. The §6controller§r goes in the middle of an outer edge of the bottom layer. The § §6Energy Input Hatch§r can go wherever you can fit it on the bottom layer. The rest of the 3x3 must be filled with §6Clean Stainless Steel Casings§r.§2 You also need a Maintenance Hatch, which can go anywhere on the structure.§r Each level above that is a ring of 7 Clean Stainless Steel Casings, one §6Fluid Output§r and nothing in the center, except for the topmost layer which needs an eighth casing to fill in the center, capping off the top. %n%nFor distilling fluids which only have one useful output, like §9Biomass§r, it is recommended to use single-block Distilleries, due to their energy efficiency and generally lower costs.

nomifactory.quest.normal.db.350.desc=The full complexity of §bNuclearCraft§r is far too much for the scope of this quest guide, so §eyou're encouraged to watch a tutorial or read a guide online§r. %n%nFor the purposes of this particular quest, you'll be building a breeder reactor to make §6Plutonium§r, and other nuclear elements. While this reactor may seem very expensive, it will be worth it, and you will probably expand it soon. %n%nThis reactor is capable of running any Low-Enriched fuel, such as TBU and LEU-235. This is a basic reactor and can be expanded, following the same pattern, to run faster. Alternatively, reactors can be designed to produce a decent amount of power for the mid game of the pack.%n%nFirst, set up your 150 §6Fission Reactor Casings§r to encase a 5x5x5 cube shape of empty air. Any of these reactor casings can be changed to §6Transparent Fission Reactor Casings§r. The Casings should only cover the faces of the interior cube, not the edges or corners. You should have exactly the right number of Casings to encase a 5x5x5 space.%n%nNext, create a hole so you can get inside the cube. Place the §6Reactor Cells§r in an alternating pattern, with the reactor cells at the corners, and spaces between each one. Alternate between each row, creating a grid pattern. Fill in the §6Cryotheum Coolers§r between, in the empty holes. Do this for every layer, alternating between §6Cryotheum Coolers§r on the corners and §6Reactor Cells§r on the corners. You should have the perfect amount of §6Reactor Cells§r and §6Cryotheum Coolers§r for this, and the third and final layers should be the same as the first one. The reactor will now be complete when you reseal it up with the Casings you removed to access the interior.%n%nFinally, place the §3Fission Reactor Controller§r along any edge or corner of the reactor. Opening the Reactor Controller GUI should let you know that the structure was properly formed; if not, go back and check what you did wrong.%n%nThe lever is placed on the reactor, as a redstone signal is required for it to start working. §cReactors can overheat and melt if the temperature exceeds its ability to cool.§r You can make a safety loop on the controller (instead of the lever) to automatically shut off the reactor when it starts getting hot using a §aRedstone Conduit§r, a §aRedstone Sensor Filter§r (on the input channel), and a §aRedstone NOT Filter§r (on the output channel).

nomifactory.quest.normal.db.727.desc=When you first started the pack, we told you that ore doubling can wait, and that's true... But you will need to start doing some rudimentary ore processing for §ebyproducts§r.%n%nByproducts are additional materials that can only be obtained from processing ores in certain machines. For example, there is no "Gallium Ore" or "Arsenic Ore". You get §6Gallium§r and §6Arsenic §ras a byproduct from processing other ores.%n%nOres have various means of processing, and eventually you'll use machine pipelines to process ores in specific ways to optimize what byproducts you gain. You can look at the §6Ore Byproduct Page§r of an ore in §bJEI§r, accessed by pressing 'U' on an ore and navigating to the byproduct tab, to see the required route to obtain desired byproducts. %n%nThe relevant machines are as follows:%n %n- §3Macerator§r: turns ores into §6Crushed Ores§r, Crushed Ores into §6Impure Dusts§r, and §6Purified Crushed Ores§r into §6Pure Dusts§r. Higher tiers of macerators have byproduct slots and gain a chance to get a full pile of byproduct from ores and both types of crushed ores.%n%n- §3Ore Washer§r: cleans Crushed Ores with §9Water§r, making Purified Crushed Ores§r, and a guaranteed 3 tiny piles of byproduct. Using §9Distilled Water§r makes them go faster. §2You can also perform a simple wash with this similar to Cauldron washing, which is extremely fast, but grants no byproducts.§r%n%n- §3Chemical Bath§r: §2uses Sodium Persulfate or Mercury to purify certain ores, granting a chance to yield a full pile of a byproduct.%n%n§r- §3Centrifuge§r: separates Pure or Impure dusts into the final material, producing a guaranteed §21 (nerfed from 3) tiny pile of byproduct§r.%n%n- §3Electrolyzer§r: uses power to split compounds into individual elements, sometimes gaining useful byproducts in the process. §2Be warned that certain dusts may be better to directly smelt instead of electrolyze!§r%n%n- §3Thermal Centrifuge§r: not to be confused with the regular Centrifuge. §2Less slow and power-hungry now, but still so. However, it yields 3 additional tiny piles of byproduct, and macerating the Centrifuged Ore can grant a special third byproduct.%n%n§2- Sifter: filters high-quality Gems from Purified Crushed gem Ores for an overall higher yield.%n%n- Electromagnetic Separator: filters magnetic metals from certain ores, increasing their yields.§r%n%nYour first forays into ore processing for byproducts will be the Electrolyzer and the Centrifuge.%n

Instead you should make §6Resonant Clathrates§r, which are an infinitely-renewable and effective source of Pulsating Dust.%n%nResonant Clathrates are made by melting §6Ender Pearls§r with a §3Fluid Extractor§r into §9Resonant Ender§r, then mixing that with §6Nether Quartz§r in an MV or better §3Chemical Reactor§r.

You can use §aPump covers§r on §bGregTech§r machines to pull fluids from or extract fluids into an interface. This is useful for routing fluids if you're already using the output side for items or a different fluid.%n%nIt is also far more performant and scales better without lag than §aFluid Import/Export Buses§r.

# db 730 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.730.title=Fluids and Autocrafting
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.730.desc=Working with fluids is a bit tricky. AE2 §aPatterns§r have no notion of fluids, meaning that you have to §ededicate separate machines to specific fluid combinations§r, ensuring they remain stocked.%n%nAE2 has a §aFluid Import Bus§r and §aFluid Export Bus§r, and this is the usual go-to for players experienced with AE2. A §aCapacity Card§r will let you export or import five specific chemicals through a single bus, which is enough for, say, §3Chemical Reactors§r. However, §cexcessive use of AE2 buses will cause lag§r.%n%nA better approach for §bGregTech§r machines is using a stocked §aFluid Interface§r and a §aPump§r or a §aFluid Regulator§r. This works almost identically to passive autocrafting with Robot Arms, and §aFluid Filters§r can allow routing specific fluids to adjacent machines. This method is much more performant, scaling without causing lag like buses. For machines from other mods, you can route fluids from a Fluid Interface with conduits.%n%n

# db 731 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.731.title=Fluid Logistics
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.731.desc=Your §3Chemical Reactors§r will be making a lot of different fluids. You'll need to manage the logistics of routing and storing all the different fluids you're automating.%n%nWherever possible, having one Chemical Reactor output directly into another machine that needs its output chemical saves you from having to figure out additional storage and routing. §aFluid Filters§r and §aPump covers§r are very useful for moving fluids around a compact processing pipeline.%n%nBut what about the final output fluids that you need elsewhere?%n%nOne option is to use the output tanks of the Chemical Reactors as a small storage buffer, letting it back up and stop crafting automatically. A §aFluid Storage Bus§r on the machine will expose the fluid to your ME Network. Whenever you need some of this fluid, your AE2 system will pull the needed fluid out and the machine will resume processing.%n%nThere's some catches with this approach though. First is that the inaccessible input tanks will also show up in AE but you won't be able to access them. You will want to set the Storage Bus to §eExport Only§r so AE doesn't try to store random fluids in the Chemical Reactor, and you may want to §ereduce the priority§r of the Storage Bus as well: this will signal to AE that you want it to remove fluids from that location first. Also, if multiple fluids are produced, §ethe machine will not resume processing if it doesn't have room for all fluid outputs§r.%n%nWhen you get access to them, it's probably just better to use single-fluid-formatted §aFluid Storage Cells§r and dump outputs into AE via Fluid Interfaces. You can fill up the cells, then pull the fluids out wherever else you need them. An alternative to this is storage buses on §3Gregtech Tanks and Drums§r.%n%n

These would certainly be an improvement over item conduits, but there's an even better solution.%n%nEnter §aItem Laser Relays§r§r: these handy tools from §bActually Additions§r allow you to create a virtual inventory out of multiple real ones; that is, you can use them to make other automation think that all of the input buses are the same inventory.%n%n§eOne important thing to note is that lasers appear to be "placed" on a particular block but they will interact with all adjacent (non-laser) blocks.§r Take this into account when placing them.%n%nTo start, place a laser on each of the input buses. Then, place the §aItem Interface§r adjacent to the laser on the first input bus. This will serve as the access point to the virtual inventory where you can connect things like an § §aME Interface§r.%n%nIf you don't have enough space in a normal pattern, try using the §6Extended Processing Pattern Terminal§r!%n%nTake your §aLaser Wrench§r and right click the first laser relay, then the second laser relay, to link them together. Repeat this with the second and third relays, third and fourth relays, etc. until they have all been linked together. Now you have a laser network virtualizing all of the input buses!%n%n§cWarning: be careful not to place a second laser on a laser network adjacent to the network's Item Interface. This will immediately crash your game because it creates a cycle in the network. You will have to either restore from backup or edit the level.dat directly to remove the block to play again.§r%n%nRemember to always use §eBlocking Mode§r when connecting the laser network to on-demand crafting. If you don't use Blocking Mode, you are likely to accidentally craft something else and jam your Assembly Line.

Stick a §664k ME Storage Component§r in, change the mode to 'Singularity', and stuff lots of items in. %n%nThe fastest way to make these is with §aFluid Lasers§r and a §6Aqueous Accumulator§r. %n%nSet the Aqueous Accumulator§r to output at a fluid laser, configure that fluid laser to `output', add a fluid laser on your matter condensor set to `input', and connect them together.%n%nIf you don't have that, you can surround it with §6Dense Cobblestone Generators§r.%n%nAfter you have made the 2 §eSingularities§r you will need from the §3Matter Condenser§r, you need to setup a §aQuantum Ring Multiblock§r. Build a 3 by 3 vertical ring with your §6Quantum Rings§r, leaving a hole in the middle. Finally, stick your §6Quantum Link Chamber§r in the hole, and connect it to your ME system. If you built it correctly, the textures of the rings should combine, leaving you with a §aMultiblock§r.%n%nWith your 2 Singularities, put it into an §3Inscriber§r or an §3Advanced Inscriber§r with a §6Advanced Card§r, resulting in a §6Quantum Link Card§r. Finally, put that into the §6Quantum Link Chamber§r of the §aQuantum Ring§r, §cNOT the Wireless Terminal§r! %n%nYou should be good to go! You can now access AE2 anywhere, including in different dimensions!

Therefore, a way to automate it is crucial.%n%nFirst, place an §6Item Laser Relay§r on each §aInjector§r, one on the §aCore§r, and one on an §aItem Interface§r. You'll notice that you will need 2 more item lasers than your amount of Injectors.%n%nConnect them all to the Item Interface with your §6Laser Wrench§r. Pretty much, just click on one of the lasers, and click on your Item Interface.%n%n§eOne important thing to note is that lasers appear to be "placed" on a particular block but they will interact with all adjacent (non-laser) blocks.§r %n%n§cWarning: be careful not to place a second laser on a laser network adjacent to the network's Item Interface. This will immediately crash your game because it creates a cycle in the network. You will have to either restore from backup or edit the level.dat directly to remove the block to play again.§r§r%n%nUse the §6Compass§r to change the Laser on the core's piority to 1. %n%nFinally, place the §aRedstone Clock§r next to the core. %n%nYou also need to setup some mechanism to take the finished item out of the core. A Phantomface works well here, as it will only output the output item, and not the input item.%n%nImport into the Item Interface.

There is no limit on how many P2P tunnels, or P2P tunnel systems, you can have on one network.%n%nBy default, a P2P tunnel is an §6ME tunnel§r, which transmits Applied Energistics channels and power. Since channels are disabled, you will most likely not be using the default tunnel. You can change the mode of your P2P tunnels by right clicking the tunnel with the respective item seen in §bJEI§r.%n%nTo configure your P2P tunnels, take a §6Memory Card§r. While holding the memory card, §ashift-right click§r the unconfigured tunnel, to set the frequency of the input, and save the frequency to the memory card. Once the first tunnel has been set up this way and the memory card is configured with the frequency, any subsequent tunnel you §aright-click§r with the memory card will be set as the output of the most recent frequency used.%n%nYou can also use memory cards to copy the configuration of ME blocks and tile-entities, such as §6Interfaces§r and §6Storage Buses§r. §aShift-right click§r a ME block to copy its configuration, and §aright-click§r to paste that configuration. Note that this doesn't copy upgrades applied to the block.%n%nYou can also §ashift-right click§r to empty the frequency, or the ME block configuration, set in the card.%n%nThis pack has §bBetter P2P§r, which adds the §6Advanced Memory Card§r.

Broken Spawners can be obtained by breaking a mob spawner. §eTIP: Spawners are all over the Lost Cities!§r%n%nThe spawner has two modes: Capture and Spawn.%n%nIn capture mode, you insert a §6Soul Vial§r into the machine, and the soul vial captures the §asoul§r of the set mob. This does not spawn any mobs, and thus works with any mob, even on peaceful.%n%nIn spawn mode, the spawner will spawn the mob that it is set to, until there is no space for them, or there are too many mobs in the area.%n%nNow you don't have to craft Soul Vials, but simply make them!

nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1039.title=MV Chemical Bath
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1039.desc=The §3Chemical Bath§r is mainly used as an ore processing machine to extract byproducts from specific §6Crushed Ores§r with either §9Sodium Persulfate§r or §9Mercury§r. It can also dye items, as well as perform some specialised processes.%n%nFor now, you will need it to cool down §6Hot Kanthal Ingots§r and §6Hot Silicon Ingots§r with §9Water§r. §9Distilled Water§r can accelerate this process if you have it.

# db 1040 of mode normal
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1040.title=§2Silicon Ingots
nomifactory.quest.normal.db.1040.desc=§6Silicon§r in its solid form is required to produce §6Transistors§r, which are required for §6HV Circuits§r. Notice that the recipe for a §6Hot Silicon Ingot§r calls for §d2,273 K§r. This is why we built §6Kanthal Coils§r earlier - §6Cupronickel Coils§r can't reach that temperature.%n%nDirectly heating §6Silicon Dust§r you get from Electrolyzing various materials is an option, but a slow and energy-hungry one. The better method is to obtain §6Silicon Dioxide Dust§r by repurposing the §6Glass§r you're producing for PPC, and heat it with §6Carbon Dust§r§r. This produces §6Silicon Ingots§r §dover 5x§r faster, with a side of §eCarbon Monoxide§r for use in various chemical processes.%n%nDon't forget that what comes out of the §3EBF§r is a §6Hot Ingot§r - cool it in a §6Chemical Bath§r first before using. Later, you will build a §3Vacuum Freezer§r which can do it better.

Each power tier starting at §1IV§r has §aLaser Hatches§r capable of transferring §d256A§r, §d1,024A§r and §d4,096A§r of their voltage's power!%n%nEnergy in the Laser Network flows from §aLaser Sources§r through §6Laser Transmitting Cables§r to §aLaser Targets§r. All these must be in a straight line - lasers don't bend, after all. Similarly to other power-related blocks, the tier of the §aLaser Target§r must not be lower than the tier of the §aLaser Source§r.%n%nYou can choose to use these when moving power between §3Active Transformers§r and your §3Power Substation§r.

# db 4 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.4.title=Iron Supply
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.4.desc=§c§rOres in §5Nomifactory§f exist in large clusters, or '§eveins§f'. These veins are scattered around the world, and are relatively common. §2The upgraded HV Electric Prospector's Scanner you were given will tell you the types of ores you can find within a 7x7 chunk area!%n§r%nWhile the Scanner requires energy to work, you are unlikely to deplete its battery. That said, there is a quest you can use to refill the energy of the scanner, which is located on this chapter.%n%nIn order to proceed, you'll need to locate a source of §6Iron§f. You have a few options. §6Magnetite§f veins are higher up and contain large amounts of iron, as well as some §6Vanadium§f and §6Gold§f. Another good source of iron is §6Limonite§f veins, which contain several types of iron. Finally, §6Pyrite§f can be found paired with §6Copper§f in several types of veins.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is obtained simply by §esmelting Iron §cNuggets§e a second time§f. It has more durability than Iron, so it is better for making tools, but §cdo not convert your entire Iron supply over to Wrought Iron§f. The two materials are not interchangeable and you'll need Iron or Wrought Iron as demanded by various recipes.

# db 5 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.5.title=Mining Hammers
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.5.desc=§aMining Hammers§r offer a relatively cheap way to mine out areas much faster.

You'll also find §6Malachite§f inside of Iron veins, this is another type of copper ore.%n%n§6Tin§f: Found essentially at ground level. §6Cassiterite§f is another type of tin ore, and they're always found together. If you cannot find a vein of tin, there are small amounts of tin inside veins of §6Aluminium§f and §6Rock Salt§f, which might be enough to hold you over until you find a proper tin vein.%n%n§6Coal§f: Found in relatively shallow depths. §6Lignite Coal§f is §2removed.%n%n§6Gold§f: Found inside of §6Magnetite§f veins, close to the surface.

# db 9 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.9.title=Ore Doubling?
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.9.desc=In most expert packs, you want to try to process as little ore as possible before you get access to ore doubling. It's a habit most of us pick up.%n%n§eYou shouldn't feel any pressure to do that in Nomifactory, though§f. Ore veins are massive, and mining is extremely fast with §aMining Hammers§f. What's more, even once you get access to §3Macerators§f, they initially process ore slowly and require power to operate.%n%nObvious exceptions would be rare materials §fbecause you can't find it. Those are worth doubling, if possible.%n%nBut at least for now, you shouldn't feel any guilt about smelting the more common ores without doubling them! §eOre doubling can be safely ignored until you have Medium Voltage machines or even later.§r

# db 10 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.10.title=§2Tier Two Micro Miner
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.10.desc=The Second Micro Miner! §2You'll need that Phosphorous in the LV Field Generators.§r%n%nThis uses an §bExtended Crafting§r table so it's not possible to automate the Miner itself with §bApplied Energistics 2§r just yet (this requires more advanced technology not easy to access until the Tier Four Micro Miner). You can make it semi-automatically by prestocking the components you need, and filling up the Extended Crafting Table with §bJEI§r!%n%nThis Micro Miner can get you:§6%n* Bauxite Ore%n§2* Pyrochlore Ore§6%n§c* Tantalite Ore§2%n* Copper Ore%n* Sphalerite Ore%n* Cassiterite Ore%n* Scheelite Ore%n* Tungstate Ore%n* Radium Salt§r%n%nAs well as the §6Stellar Creation Data§r, which will be useful much, much later.

# db 11 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.11.title=§2Electronics Subcomponents
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.11.desc=A "§esubstrate§f" is the "board" part of a circuit board... the backing that the circuit components and wires are laid into. A good substrate needs to not conduct electricity, for obvious reasons. §6Wood§r coated in §6Sticky Resin§r is a primitive but effective material to use as your first substrate.%n%n§2CEu circuit progression means you also have to put wires on your substrates for them to be usable. In this case, use some Copper Wires.§r%n%nYou'll also need to make §6Vacuum Tubes§f, as well as some primitive §6Resistors§r. §6Paper§r will work as a material for these, for now.%n%nMake sure to code these recipes into a §3Crafting Station§r... you'll be making a LOT of these things.

# db 12 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.12.title=Some Starter Tools
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.12.desc=One of the eccentricities of the pack you'll need to get used to is the way the tools are displayed. Most tools can be made out of nearly any metal, and §bJEI§f will display a huge number of options... every combination of every tool with every material. However, the pattern to make the tool is always identical, so §ejust arrange the plates and ingots in the same manner as the examples, ignoring whatever material it says§f. Rods where rods go, plates where plates, etc. The only restriction is that tools §emust be made from all of the same material§f... you cannot mix and match different metals in a single item.%n%nRecipes will default to showing a §6Iron Tool §rof the appropriate type if a tool is required, but the correct type of tool made out of any metal will work. Just ignore the tool's material in the recipes: it can be whatever you'd like.%n%nFor now, make a §aHammer§f (not a §aMining Hammer§f, mind you... six ingots, not five). Hammers can be used to turn §etwo ingots into one plate§f. §6Plates§f can make a §aFile§f, Files can make §6Rods§f, etc. Use JEI to work your way down the list of tools.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is probably your best bet for a tool material right now, but better materials will become available as you progress. %n%nThis quest technically accepts any tool material, but it is highly recommended to use §6Wrought Iron§r.

# db 13 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.13.title=Batch Crafting In Style
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.13.desc=If you try to craft each item only when you need it, you'll go insane. It is far more effective to §ebatch-craft§f frequently used items so you don't have to do it as often. It is very satisfying to get all the ingredients together then craft §ea stack of items§f all at once.%n%n§3Crafting Stations§f are an indispensable tool for batch-crafting. They can save recipes for all the steps in production chains for things like tools, circuits, machine casings, and more. You will want to §emake several of them§r§r for the convenience they offer.%n%nEach Crafting Station comes with some inventory space for general items, as well as a dedicated row specifically for holding §bGregTech§r tools. In addition, Crafting Stations can §einteract with adjacent inventories§r, so you can keep common materials in a container between them. This includes access points to large virtual inventories, like a §aDrawer Controller§r§r, which you will be able to make later.%n%nTo use the Crafting Station, you must either manually set up a recipe in the pattern area, or click-in a table recipe from §bJEI§r. Place the ingredients inside the Crafting Station or an adjacent container, then you can click the resulting item to craft it. Once an item is crafted, the recipe will appear on the top-right in the history pane. As usual, Shift-clicking the output item will craft up to a stack of it.%n%nEach Crafting Station will remember §eup to the last nine recipes§r you made in them, which can be recalled by clicking the item in the top-right recipe history pane. Old recipes will be cycled out, so if you want to ensure a recipe doesn't ever get replaced by a different one, §eShift-click the recipe in the history pane to lock it§r.%n%nThe available ingredients from neighboring inventories are visible through the §eStorage§r tab on the Crafting Station, and you can also place items into this tab to send them to available neighboring inventories.

The way that it works is that each level of the tower after the first will output an additional fluid from the recipe. §cAny output fluids in excess of available buses are voided§r. %n%nWhat you need the Distillation Tower for initially is to break down §9Oil§r and §9Fermented Biomass§r into useful resources.§9 Oil§r distillation, with its four outputs, will require a §efive-block-high Distillation Tower§r (the quest materials are for such a tower; if you want to build it bigger, you will need §ean additional 7 casings and 1 fluid output per floor§r).%n%nAny recipe with more than four output fluids (like §9Fermented Biomass§r) will need a larger tower. Make sure to increase the height of your tower to accommodate all of the outputs you want to keep. Also check the voltage requirements of the recipes, as many Distillation Tower recipes need higher voltages than MV. §eYou can swap out your Energy Input for a higher tier one when that time comes§r. Also, any recipe that has an item output will need an §6Output Bus§r, anywhere on the bottom layer.%n%nThe tower we'll be building at first is 3x3x5 (LxWxH), with a hollow center. The §6Fluid Input Hatch§r §2can go anywhere on the bottom layer.§r. The §6controller§r goes in the middle of an outer edge of the bottom layer. The § §6Energy Input Hatch§r can go wherever you can fit it on the bottom layer. The rest of the 3x3 must be filled with §6Clean Stainless Steel Casings§r.§2 You also need a Maintenance Hatch, which can go anywhere on the structure.§r Each level above that is a ring of 7 Clean Stainless Steel Casings, one §6Fluid Output§r and nothing in the center, except for the topmost layer which needs an eighth casing to fill in the center, capping off the top. %n%nFor distilling fluids which only have one useful output, like §9Biomass§r, it is recommended to use single-block Distilleries, due to their energy efficiency and generally lower costs.

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.350.desc=The full complexity of §bNuclearCraft§r is far too much for the scope of this quest guide, so §eyou're encouraged to watch a tutorial or read a guide online§r. %n%nFor the purposes of this particular quest, you'll be building a breeder reactor to make §6Plutonium§r, and other nuclear elements. While this reactor may seem very expensive, it will be worth it, and you will probably expand it soon. %n%nThis reactor is capable of running any Low-Enriched fuel, such as TBU and LEU-235. This is a basic reactor and can be expanded, following the same pattern, to run faster. Alternatively, reactors can be designed to produce a decent amount of power for the mid game of the pack.%n%nFirst, set up your 150 §6Fission Reactor Casings§r to encase a 5x5x5 cube shape of empty air. Any of these reactor casings can be changed to §6Transparent Fission Reactor Casings§r. The Casings should only cover the faces of the interior cube, not the edges or corners. You should have exactly the right number of Casings to encase a 5x5x5 space.%n%nNext, create a hole so you can get inside the cube. Place the §6Reactor Cells§r in an alternating pattern, with the reactor cells at the corners, and spaces between each one. Alternate between each row, creating a grid pattern. Fill in the §6Cryotheum Coolers§r between, in the empty holes. Do this for every layer, alternating between §6Cryotheum Coolers§r on the corners and §6Reactor Cells§r on the corners. You should have the perfect amount of §6Reactor Cells§r and §6Cryotheum Coolers§r for this, and the third and final layers should be the same as the first one. The reactor will now be complete when you reseal it up with the Casings you removed to access the interior.%n%nFinally, place the §3Fission Reactor Controller§r along any edge or corner of the reactor. Opening the Reactor Controller GUI should let you know that the structure was properly formed; if not, go back and check what you did wrong.%n%nThe lever is placed on the reactor, as a redstone signal is required for it to start working. §cReactors can overheat and melt if the temperature exceeds its ability to cool.§r You can make a safety loop on the controller (instead of the lever) to automatically shut off the reactor when it starts getting hot using a §aRedstone Conduit§r, a §aRedstone Sensor Filter§r (on the input channel), and a §aRedstone NOT Filter§r (on the output channel).

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.727.desc=When you first started the pack, we told you that ore doubling can wait, and that's true... But you will need to start doing some rudimentary ore processing for §ebyproducts§r.%n%nByproducts are additional materials that can only be obtained from processing ores in certain machines. For example, there is no "Gallium Ore" or "Arsenic Ore". You get §6Gallium§r and §6Arsenic §ras a byproduct from processing other ores.%n%nOres have various means of processing, and eventually you'll use machine pipelines to process ores in specific ways to optimize what byproducts you gain. You can look at the §b§b§6Ore Byproduct Page§6§r of an ore in §bJEI§r, accessed by pressing 'U' on an ore and navigating to the byproduct tab, to see the required route to obtain desired byproducts. %n%nThe relevant machines are as follows:%n %n- §3Macerator§r: turns ores into §6Crushed Ores§r, Crushed Ores into §6Impure Dusts§r, and §6Purified Crushed Ores§r into §6Pure Dusts§r. Higher tiers of macerators have byproduct slots and gain a chance to get a full pile of byproduct from ores and both types of crushed ores.%n%n- §3Ore Washer§r: cleans Crushed Ores with §9Water§r, making Purified Crushed Ores§r, and a guaranteed 3 tiny piles of byproduct. Using §9Distilled Water§r makes them go faster. §2You can also perform a simple wash with this similar to Cauldron washing, which is extremely fast, but grants no byproducts.§r%n%n- §3Chemical Bath§r: §2uses Sodium Persulfate or Mercury to purify certain ores, granting a chance to yield a full pile of a byproduct.%n%n§r- §3§3Centrifuge§r: separates Pure or Impure dusts into the final material, producing a guaranteed §21 (nerfed from 3) tiny pile of byproduct§r.%n%n- §3Electrolyzer§r: uses power to split compounds into individual elements, sometimes gaining useful byproducts in the process. §2Be warned that certain dusts may be better to directly smelt instead of electrolyze!§r%n%n- §3Thermal Centrifuge§r: not to be confused with the regular Centrifuge. §2Less slow and power-hungry now, but still so. However, it yields 3 additional tiny piles of byproduct, and macerating the Centrifuged Ore can grant a special third byproduct.%n%n§2- Sifter: filters high-quality Gems from Purified Crushed gem Ores for an overall higher yield.%n%n- Electromagnetic Separator: filters magnetic metals from certain ores, increasing their yields.§r%n%nYour first forays into ore processing for byproducts will be the Electrolyzer and the Centrifuge.%n

Instead you should make §6Resonant Clathrates§r, which are an infinitely-renewable and effective source of Pulsating Dust.%n%nResonant Clathrates are made by melting §6Ender Pearls§r with a §3Fluid Extractor§r into §9Resonant Ender§r, then mixing that with §6Nether Quartz§r in an MV or better §3Chemical Reactor§r.

You can use §aPump covers§r on §bGregTech§r machines to pull fluids from or extract fluids into an interface. This is useful for routing fluids if you're already using the output side for items or a different fluid.%n%nIt is also far more performant and scales better without lag than §aFluid Import/Export Buses§r.

# db 730 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.730.title=Fluids and Autocrafting
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.730.desc=Working with fluids is a bit tricky. AE2 §aPatterns§r have no notion of fluids, meaning that you have to §ededicate separate machines to specific fluid combinations§r, ensuring they remain stocked.%n%nAE2 has a §aFluid Import Bus§r and §aFluid Export Bus§r, and this is the usual go-to for players experienced with AE2. A §aCapacity Card§r will let you export or import five specific chemicals through a single bus, which is enough for, say, §3Chemical Reactors§r. However, §cexcessive use of AE2 buses will cause lag§r.%n%nA better approach for §bGregTech§r machines is using a stocked §aFluid Interface§r and a §aPump§r or a §aFluid Regulator§r. This works almost identically to passive autocrafting with Robot Arms, and §aFluid Filters§r can allow routing specific fluids to adjacent machines. This method is much more performant, scaling without causing lag like buses. For machines from other mods, you can route fluids from a Fluid Interface with conduits.%n%n

# db 731 of mode expert
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.731.title=Fluid Logistics
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.731.desc=Your §3Chemical Reactors§r will be making a lot of different fluids. You'll need to manage the logistics of routing and storing all the different fluids you're automating.%n%nWherever possible, having one Chemical Reactor output directly into another machine that needs its output chemical saves you from having to figure out additional storage and routing. §aFluid Filters§r and §aPump covers§r are very useful for moving fluids around a compact processing pipeline.%n%nBut what about the final output fluids that you need elsewhere?%n%nOne option is to use the output tanks of the Chemical Reactors as a small storage buffer, letting it back up and stop crafting automatically. A §aFluid Storage Bus§r on the machine will expose the fluid to your ME Network. Whenever you need some of this fluid, your AE2 system will pull the needed fluid out and the machine will resume processing.%n%nThere's some catches with this approach though. First is that the inaccessible input tanks will also show up in AE but you won't be able to access them. You will want to set the Storage Bus to §eExport Only§r so AE doesn't try to store random fluids in the Chemical Reactor, and you may want to §ereduce the priority§r of the Storage Bus as well: this will signal to AE that you want it to remove fluids from that location first. Also, if multiple fluids are produced, §ethe machine will not resume processing if it doesn't have room for all fluid outputs§r.%n%nWhen you get access to them, it's probably just better to use single-fluid-formatted §aFluid Storage Cells§r and dump outputs into AE via Fluid Interfaces. You can fill up the cells, then pull the fluids out wherever else you need them.%n%n

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.809.title=Setting Up Autocrafting
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.809.desc=This quest teaches you the basics about §bApplied Energistics 2§r autocrafting. If you are new this mod, it is highly recommended that you watch a video or read a guide online. Just remember that channels are disabled by default in this pack.%n%nBy now, you should have §6ME Interfaces, §6Molecular Assemblers, Crafting Units, Patterns§r and a §6Pattern Terminal§r. %n%nFirst, for all crafts, you'll need a §eCrafting CPU§r. These are structures that must be in a rectangular prism, and can be only one block. These compose of:%n* §6Crafting Storages§r, which determine how big a craft can be. For now, §64K Crafting Storages§r should be enough. You must have at least one per CPU.%n* §6Co-Processing Units§r, which are used to craft multiple things at once. These are optional.%n* §6Crafting Monitors§r, used to see what is crafting. Not needed, and you can right-click on the CPU to find out what is crafting anyways, so this is pretty much just decoration.%n* §6Crafting Units§r, which aren't needed at all, and are just used to fill holes, if you have a lack of materials.%n%nSecond, you'll need the place for the autocrafting. For Crafting Table recipes, you'll need §6Molecular Assemblers§r. §6Interfaces§r are placed next to them. Autocrafting with §bGregTech§r is explained later, in the quest following this one.%n%nFinally, you'll need a §6Pattern§r. In order to make this, put empty §6Patterns§r in the §6Pattern Terminal§r, and find the recipe in §bJEI§r, while still in the §6Pattern Terminal§r. Then, click '+' in §bJEI§r, and press the arrow to encode the recipe. This goes in the §6Interface§r that you set up in the last step. You can use §6Interface Terminals§r to access §6Interfaces'§r pattern slots.%n%nEventually, you'll need a lot of §6Patterns§r, lots of CPUs, and ones with more storage, and lots of §6§6§6Interfaces§r§r§r. If you run out of pattern slots in an §6Interface§r, you can add more §6Interfaces§r, or use newly added §6Pattern Expansion Cards§r, which add 9 slots each. You can have a maximum of 3 §6Pattern Expansion Cards§r in an §6Interface§r, which makes the amount of pattern slots go to 36.

Refer to §eJEI§r for some other possible setups.%n%nThe §dCWU/t§r of the HPCA is determined by the sum of the outputs of the §3HPCA Computation Components§r within it. Regular §3Computation Components§r produce §d4 CWU/t§r each, and require §d2 Cooling§r each. §3Advanced Computation Components§r, which you do not have access to yet, produce §d16 CWU/t§r each and require §d4 Cooling§r each.%n%n§dCooling§r is provided by §3Cooler§r blocks within the structure. §3Passive Coolers§r provide §d1 Cooling§r each for free, whereas §3Active Coolers§r provide §d2 Cooling§r each with a steady flow of §9Dielectric PCB Coolant§r, provided through an §3Input Hatch§r. If the Cooling within the HPCA is insufficient, the components may be §cdamaged§r from overheating. The physical position of the components within the HPCA does not matter.%n%nA §3Bridge Component§r may be installed, allowing the HPCA to connect to §3Network Switches§r.%n%nThe energy consumption of the HPCA is determined by the sum of its parts. 'Max Energy' refers to the power draw while the HPCA is computing, while 'Upkeep Energy' refers to the power draw when the HPCA is idling.

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.948.title=§2Network Switch
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.948.desc=The §3Network Switch§r combines any number of §3Computation Data Reception Hatches§r into any number of §3Computation Data Transmission Hatches§r. This will be required when the §dCWU/t§r requirements of your §3Research Station§r exceed what a single §3HPCA§r can provide.%n%nConnect the §3Computation Data Reception Hatches§r§r to your §3HPCAs§r with §3Bridge Components§r within them, and connect a single §3Computation Data Transmission Hatch§r to your §3Research Station§r, and it will receive the sum of §dCWU/t§r from all of your HPCAs!%n%nNow, all §3Assembly Line§r recipes are available to you, given you have the §dCWU/t§r to research them. The most computationally demanding scan, for the §6Ultimate Battery§r, requires §d144 CWU/t§r.%n%nThe Network Switch consumes §d7,680 EU/t§r per §3Computation Hatch§r in its structure.

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.949.title=§2Advanced HPCA
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.949.desc=Once you scan and make make your first §6UV Circuits§r and §6ZPM Field Generators§r, you can upgrade your §3HPCA Computing Components§r to §3Advanced Components§r. These produce §d16 CWU/t§r each and require §d4 Cooling§r each.%n%nWith them, you can upgrade a single HPCA to produce §d32 CWU/t§r total - enough for basic §6UV components§r, and the §3Network Switch§r, which will allow you to go higher.

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.950.title=MV Chemical Bath
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.950.desc=The §3Chemical Bath§r is mainly used as an ore processing machine to extract byproducts from specific §6Crushed Ores§r with either §9Sodium Persulfate§r or §9Mercury§r. It can also dye items, as well as perform some specialised processes.%n%nFor now, you will need it to cool down §6Hot Kanthal Ingots§r and §6Hot Silicon Ingots§r with §9Water§r. §9Distilled Water§r can accelerate this process if you have it.%n%nAre you facing a shortage of §6Gold§r? This can net you some extra Gold by bathing §6Crushed Ores§r in §9Mercury§r, or §6Crushed Iron Ore§r in §9Sodium Persulfate§r.

nomifactory.quest.expert.db.951.title=§2Silicon Ingots
nomifactory.quest.expert.db.951.desc=§6Silicon§r in its solid form is required to produce §6Transistors§r, which are required for §6HV Circuits§r. Notice that the recipe for a §6Hot Silicon Ingot§r calls for §d2,273 K§r. This is why we built §6Kanthal Coils§r earlier - §6Cupronickel Coils§r can't reach that temperature.%n%nDirectly heating §6Silicon Dust§r you get from Electrolyzing various materials is an option, but a slow and energy-hungry one. The better method is to obtain §6Silicon Dioxide Dust§r by repurposing the §6Glass§r you're producing for PPC, and heat it with §6Carbon Dust§r§r. This produces §6Silicon Ingots§r §dover 5x§r faster, with a side of §eCarbon Monoxide§r for use in various chemical processes.%n%nDon't forget that what comes out of the §3EBF§r is a §6Hot Ingot§r - cool it in a §6Chemical Bath§r first before using. Later, you will build a §3Vacuum Freezer§r which can do it better.
