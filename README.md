Note: This chart is from the [Weblate Repo](https://weblate.pantsu.moe/projects/nomi-ceu-translations/) for Nomi-CEu-Translations. For the moment, this is hosted on a [fork of the main repo](https://github.com/marisathewitch/Nomi-CEu-Translations).

## Why are there English Lang Files?
These are for the translators to base off, and are automatically updated when a commit occurs in that module, with a delay of 30s - 2min.
These are not included in resource pack builds.
